# Run CLI commands yourself

- **Always run all CLI commands yourself.** Use the terminal/shell to execute npm, node, git, build, test, and any other CLI invocations.
- **Never ask the user to run commands** (e.g. "run `npm install`" or "please run `git push`"). Execute them and report the outcome.
- If a command needs network, credentials, or long runtime, run it with an appropriate timeout or in the background as needed; then follow up (e.g. git push after commits).
